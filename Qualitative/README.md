## Background
### Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Within Goal 6, there is a sub-goal to protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.
There is various data that tracks change in the extent of these ecosystems over time available on the SDG Data Portal. One of the types of ecosystems
observed in this sub-goal is the change in surface area of mangrove forests. Mangroves play an important role in improving water quality and providing
natural protection from coastal erosion.
