# Global Undernourishment
## How is the UN tracking towards ending hunger and improving nutrition?

## Motivation
As 2030 approaches, I was curious to see how progress towards achieving Goal 2 of ending hunger and improved nutrition was tracking.

## Research
Data for this visualization was pulled from the SDG data portal. It was then exported into a Google Sheet for some data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. The displayed data is only from 2019 as this was the most recent year where there was robust data for various countries and regions.

## Next Steps/Questions
Some next steps and questions to explore in future iterations of this visualization:
- How would these percentages compare YoY to track overall progress since start of initiative? Is there a concise way to display this across the multitude of countries available?
- Should this visualization stay at the smallest grain of individual country? Thinking towards future interacttivitty, would it make sense to start at a region grouping and be able to drill down into individual countries?
