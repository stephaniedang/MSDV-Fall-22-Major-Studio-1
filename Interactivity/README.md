## Interactivity Project
### How sustainable is your fish?
This visualization will explore how sustainable global fish stocks are across different major fishing areas defined by the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization. As fish consumption continues to grow across the world, overfishing becomes an increasingly pressing issue. I'm interested
in exploring how fish stocks are fairing across oceans, which commonly harvested fish are from those regions, and what we as consumers can do to better
combat overfishing. I'm creating this as an interactive/narrative version to create a connection between the idea of overfishing and how that manifests
into our daily lives. The dataset for this visualization will be from the SDG Data Portal and the FAO website. The visualization methods used primarily 
for this narrative will be line charts and ridgeline charts to show year-over-year trends.
